# Benford Distribution Analysis with Genetic Algorithms and Complex Network Models

This repository contains the code and report for a project that explores the application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to determine optimal parameters for fitting the Benford distribution to Weibull, lognormal, and Pareto distributions. Additionally, it assesses the J-Divergence of complex network models concerning their conformity to Benford's Law and investigates the probability density function (PDF) of Benford's Law.
